# Parser ad data visualizer for Arecoreder 

## Installing

In order to run program you need python 3 with installed matplotlib 
```shell
pip install matplotlib
```
and csv
```shell
pip install csv
```

## Usage

To use this software you need to put a file with measurments into folder with Parser.py and then execute said .py file with:

```shell
python Parser.py
```
**Keep in mind that this program will open first file with name `MEAS*.csv` that is present in folder, for opening multiple files keep them in separate folders**

After few seconds, depending on .csv file size window should pop up. 

## Data format

After opening window, 4 subplots should appear:
* First one visualizes accelerations on all 3 axis in `24g` range
* Second plots pressure in form of RAW data and Kalman filtered
* Third shows altitude obtained from pressure and second order acceleration integral
* Last one is velocity from pressure and acceleration integral
